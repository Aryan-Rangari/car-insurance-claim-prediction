# 🚗 Car Insurance Claim Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a car insurance policyholder will file a claim and estimate the cost of that claim using machine learning models. The task is divided into **two parts**: **classification** and **regression**.

## 📘 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from:  
🔗 [Kaggle - Car Insurance Claim Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiaomengsun/car-insurance-claim-data)

It contains approximately **8,000 records** of car insurance policyholders with features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Income
- Claim history
- Number of vehicles
- And more...

> **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to size restrictions. Please download it manually from Kaggle.

## 📊 Results Overview

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Built classification models to predict claim occurrence (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Built regression models to estimate claim cost (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost)
- Evaluated models using **accuracy**, **ROC AUC**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**
